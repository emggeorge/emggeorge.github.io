                            <p> Writing this feels a little like changing with my window open; no one and everyone is watching at the same time. </p>

                            <p> When I've sat down to write this, I've felt overwhelmed by need to write something worth reading. My relationship 
                                with writing is long and deep; I've been keeping a diary since 2014, but the strength of a diary is what holds me 
                                back in this moment. To cross the threshold from private to public is something I don't know how to do. </p>

                            <p> So I'm moving slowly. This blog will move slowly. It already has, taking me many months to go from playground to 
                                finished object. I am at a part of my life, though, where I want to move slowly. Not slow in a lazy way, but slow like 
                                a tsunami, working my way across the ocean, collecting energy and matter, so that someday, when I am ready, I may crash 
                                with my full self into the shore. </p>

                            <p> That's what why I'm writing this blog and setting up this website. It's the corner where I can tend to the public parts 
                                of myself, exposing what I believe to the risks that come with being seen and hoping that the process changes me. </p>
